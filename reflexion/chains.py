Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events lead to reduced agricultural output, particularly in vulnerable regions. For instance, studies indicate that a 1Â°C increase in global temperature could reduce wheat yields by up to 6% in some areas. Additionally, climate change exacerbates water scarcity, further threatening food production. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, up to 122 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty due to climate-related impacts on agriculture.
